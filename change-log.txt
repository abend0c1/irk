           -------- ----- --- -------------------------------------------------
           20121025 2.07  AJA Added extra Consumer Device function descriptions.
                              These are optional, but make IRK easier to use.
           20121020 2.06  AJA Increased the WIDTH_ERROR_MARGIN from 100 to 300
                              microseconds (that to half the smallest pulse
                              width). This has fixed the sensitivity problem.
                              Also added a debug on/off local IRK function.
                              Now displays graphic symbols for up/down/left/
                              right/pause and backslash on the LCD.           
           20121009 2.05  AJA Fixed the pulse width check introduced in 2.04.
           20120813 2.04  AJA Reduced training burst interval to conform with
                              the TSOP4838 data sheet. Training burst reduced
                              from 9000 to 1000 microseconds. Silence after
                              training burst reduced from 4500 to 600 microseconds.
                              Added extra pulse width checks.
           20120312 2.03  AJA Repackaged the lot into a single zip file
           20120310 2.02  AJA USB buffer overwrite problem seems to have been
                              fixed in MikroC Pro v5.40 so I've removed the
                              workaround of using a 2nd buffer. Fine tuned the
                              USBdsc.c settings - use a slower polling rate and
                              a few other minor changes.
           20120308 2.01  AJA Allow local IRK! functions such as Backlight On
                              to be programmed to a remote control button.
           20120215 2.00  AJA Rewrite to support Consumer Devices usage page
                              and other usage pages in the future
           20101122 1.19  AJA Detect USB ready using HID_Write (not HID_Read)
           20101120 1.18  AJA Added "Init USB" function
           20101106 1.17  AJA Use LATC for outputs
           20101023 1.16  AJA Don't try to send keystroke when USB is not ready
           20101007 1.15  AJA Workaround USB send problem by using 2nd buffer
           20100923 1.14  AJA Detect when power good from USB then init USB
           20100911 1.13  AJA Recompiled with MikroC v3.8 (new USB interface)
           20100828 1.12  AJA Added button debounce delay
           20100810 1.11  AJA USB D+ and D- swapped (doc updated)
           20100806 1.10  AJA LCD backlight polarity swapped (doc updated)
